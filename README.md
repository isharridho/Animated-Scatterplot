# Animated-Scatterplot

Scatterplot is a graph that can be used to see the pattern of the relationship between 2 variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values ​​for an individual data point.
Scatterplots are usually rendered using the seaborn or matplotlib libraries. 
However, to make it more attractive, the scatterplot can also be displayed with an animated display using the plotly.express library by setting the 'animation_frame' parameter. This animated display is suitable for data that has a timeframe such as a year.

The following scatterplot shows the relationship between feature life expectancy and gross domestic product (GDP) in each country from 1952 to 2007.
